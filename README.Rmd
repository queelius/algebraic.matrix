## R Library: `algebraic.matrix`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a algebraic matrix R library. It is mostly an API designed to make working with matrices
easier, where you can define your own matrix type, say, a Hessian matrix, or a invertible matrix,
and then use the API to do operations on it. Often, since the matrix object is specialized,
the operations will be more efficient or more accurate than the generic operations.
